 abstract = {Since the holobiont concept came into the limelight ten years ago, we have become aware that responses of holobionts to climate change stressors may be driven by shifts in the microbiota. However, the complex interactions underlying holobiont responses across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems remain largely unresolved. One of the key factors driving these responses is the infochemical-mediated communication in the holobiont. In order to come up with a holistic picture, in this Viewpoint we compare mechanisms and infochemicals in the rhizosphere of plants and the eco-chemosphere of seaweeds in response to climate change stressors and other environmental stressors, including drought, warming and nutrient stress. Furthermore, we discuss the inclusion of chemical ecology concepts that are of crucial importance in driving holobiont survival, adaptation and/or holobiont breakdown. Infochemicals can thus be regarded as a â€˜missing link' in our understanding of holobiont response to climate change and should be investigated while investigating the responses of plant and seaweed holobionts to climate change. This will set the basis for improving our understanding of holobiont responses to climate change stressors across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.},
