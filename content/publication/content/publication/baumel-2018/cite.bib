 abstract = {The Human Microbiome, as well as the exploration of the microorganisms inhabiting the human body, are not only integral to the field of microbiology but represent an intrinsic part of all human beings. Consequently, along with scientists, artists have been inspired by the microbiome: transforming it in to tangible artefacts in order to critically question, reflect on and break down the barrier between humans and their microcohabitants. By artistic means, artists help us to understand how microbial research topics are inevitably affected by societal influences, including (health) politics, economics and the arts. Fifty Percent Human is a multidisciplinary artistic research project that aims to reshape our understanding of the human body and its environment as well as to explore possibilities for conscious coexistence in order to bridge the gap between science and society. We are 50% human With the help of microbiologists, humans are slowly coming to the understanding that our bodies are ecosystems rich in biodiversity, which contain complex societies of microbes living in and on our bodies. One can even ponder how human we really are, when taking into account that microorganisms cover the entire outer surface of our body, including our skin, gut, vagina and mouth (The Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012). Drawing on microbiologists' claims that 90 per cent of cells that constitute our body are not human but bacterial (Savage, 1977; Brown, 2010), we can begin to visualize the human body as a complex ecosystem. Recently, more in-depth calculations have "upgraded" our humanness, showing that about 50 % of cells being human (Sender et al., 2016a,b). Fifty Percent Human was initiated by and is part of Sonja B€ aumel's ongoing research and creative process through which a multidisciplinary team examined, questioned and challenged the relationship between the human body and its microbial cohabitants. In particular, the project aimed to see how the concept of the Human Microbiome can be critically challenged and how artists can play a role in translating research, often perceived as something abstract to laymen, into a more tangible and immediate experience. To question and shape the relational and context-dependent aspects of the human existence, it needs to be grasped as complete as possible, that is down to its tiniest components, including human body cells and the non-human cohabitants of the body, its microbes. Today, however, the discrepancy between people's perception of the functions and purposes of microbes and the essentiality of microorganisms to our existence could not be larger. Laymen often perceive microorganisms as dangerous creatures and sources of diseases, taking hygienic practices to the level of germophobia. Fifty Percent Human aims to challenge this perception by allowing people to reach out to their microbes and explore the potential of their microbial self. It strives to help people to realize that we are much more than who we think we are and to recognize microbial life forms as actors that coshape our bodies, as well as our physical and mental constitution (Rees et al., 2018).
