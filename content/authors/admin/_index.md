Hi! I am a microbial ecologist & data scientist based in in Tiohtià:ke/Montréal, Canada. At the moment, I work as a Postdoctoral Fellow between the Microbial Ecology group at the National Institute of Scientific Research (INRS) and the data analytics company Plotly. My research combines Omic technologies with data visualization tools, like Dash for R to study microbes that can help plants withstand drought.

Apart from dealing with microbes and data, I am passionate about bridging art & science and making science more inclusive and accessible for which I have been active in organization including 500 Women Scientists, the Quebec Center for Biodiversity Science (QCBS) and the International Society for Microbial Ecology (ISME).
