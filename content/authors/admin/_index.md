Hi! I am a microbial ecologist turned data scientist. I am passionate about digging into data and extracting and communicating meaningful information from them. Currently, I work as a freelance data and policy analyst at DataMoves and as a data scientist at Nextgem - a data science consultancy firm based in The Netherlands. Having worked with research institutes, policy organizations and the private sector, I have a broad range of experience and expertise.

During my time as a researcher I looked at how [microbes that can help plants withstand drought](https://theconversation.com/microbial-aromas-might-save-crops-from-drought-103960) by combining Omic technologies with open source data visualization tools, like [Dash for R](https://medium.com/plotly/announcing-dash-for-r-82dce99bae13). To translate science into policy, I have been working for organizations like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).

When I'm not dealing with microbes and data, I merge [art & science](https://www.sciartmagazine.com/the-art-of-microbial-communication.html) and contribute to making science more inclusive and accessible for which I have been active in organization including 500 Women Scientists, the Quebec Center for Biodiversity Science (QCBS), the International Society for Microbial Ecology (ISME) as well as the Montr√©al based community lab Bricobio.
